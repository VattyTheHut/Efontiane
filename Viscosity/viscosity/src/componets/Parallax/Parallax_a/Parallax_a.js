                      Your business and all that revolves around it should be an extension 
                      of the owner’s vision. <br />The website has become arguably the quintessential 
                      component In creating  a successful business. <br />It acts as the “visual 
                      headquarters” for consumers to see. When you think of google, <br />most don’t 
                      picture postmodern architecture with thousands of engineer employees in <br /> 
                      dynamic cubicles or a mainframe storage facilities the size of football 
                      stadiums.

                      <p>
                      What people see a simple and elegant word, padded under a search <br />bar ready to 
                      answer any question conjurable. A website should speak for the company.<br />  
                      We want to provide websites to consumers with the aesthetic elegance and versaille
                      of <br />a 15 century french fountain but with the productivity and efficiency of an <br />
                      industrial factory hence the name electronic “fountain” | web factory.

                      We take a lot of our core ideologies from the great Andy warhol, someone who believed in the 
                      <br />convergence of consumerism as a purpose of function and culture for the purposes of propaganda.<br />
                      That's to say; having a good looking website shouldn't cost an arm and leg but <br />also shouldn't be 
                      cumbersome to manage as well. It should stand at the forefront of <br />an enterprise and work towards 
                      giving a client a  rich and fulfilling experience.

                  Efontaine will be implementing its own inhouse engine [viscosity-react] 
                  for 90% of site development. Viscosity is a react.js code based composed 
                  of css and js middleware as well as original eFontaine technologies. 
                  Viscosity was made for speed and versatility. 
                  made to automate most of the development process and allow us to 
                  finish quicker without compromising on quality.
                  All  programming languages, library and 
                  frameworks used in the development process
